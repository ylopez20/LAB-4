# LAB-4

### GitHub update
I have found that you can create folders on GitHub by going to the "create new file" button on the code screen of the repository, then typing in the name of the folder you want, a '/', and then the name of a file (you can use "test.md" if you don't know what file name you need.)

This will then allow you to create the file you want to submit the same way inside that folder, and then pasting the code you created into it.  I have noticed that GitHub has some issue formatting code, so you will need to do some formatting after you paste it.

This is an alternative to cloneing the repo, and then commmitting your changes, pushing them to your repo, and then creating a pull request for your changes.

### Components of the lab
We have been talking about functions, and for this lab, I am going to ask you to work with function in creating your programs.
I would like you to complete what you can prior to next Wednesday's Lecture.

* Write a program to take in a string, have a function that will reverse the string.  Call this function, and then print the reversed result.
* Write a program to convert a temperature from F to C.  Put the logic in a function. 
* Write a program that will print out the side lengths of a triangle given the three vetices (one point per line in the form "# #".)  You may assume that the vertexes of the triangle lie on integer coordinates.  (use functions as you feel it is useful.)
* Sorting:  There are multiple ways to implement sorting.  I want you to think through how you might sort a list of integers, and then write a program that will sort the numbers in that way.  Use a function for the sort opporation of your program, and in this function call another function to state weatehr you need to make a change or not with the cards you are looking at (the cards the program should be looking at). This progrm will need to use an array to store the number in.

#### Recursion

* Write a program that takes an integer, and prints the factorial of the integer.  ex: 5 factorial is 5*4*3*2*1
* Write a
